// Variables
// Variables are used to store data.

// Declaring a variable firstName
var firstName = "Scott";

//Logging the value of firstName to the console
// console.log(firstName);
// Giving firstName a value
// firstname = Scott;
//Logging the value of a firstName again
console.log (firstName);

// Declaring a variable called className and giving it a value of BCSkills
var className= "BC Skills";
 var age=38;
 console.log(age);
 var lastName="Hurt";
 console.log(lastName);

 //Variables are case-sensitive so y is different than capital Y
 var y=10;
 console.log(y);
 var Y=15;
 console.log(Y);
 //The equal sign is known as the assignment operator. This is because it's used to assign a value to a variable.
 //We can also declare and assign values to multiple variables at same time

 //Here we are making three new variables, make, year, and model, and assigning them values
 var make = "Chrysler", year = 2015, model = "300";
 console.log(make+" "+ model +" " + year);

 schoolName = "Barren";

 console.log(schoolName.length);
 //Make a variable containing a string of your full name.
 var fullName="Scott Hurt";
 //Make a variable containing a string of your address.
 var address="100 Noah Drive Glasgow, Ky 42141";
 //Print out both of the variables.
 console.log(fullName);
 console.log(address);
 //String Concatenation
 //We can add strings together to make even larger string.
 
 var nameAndAddress = fullName + address;
 console.log(nameAndAddress);
 // Numbers
 // Numbers behave as you would expect. We can add subtract multiply divide, etc. Numbers can have decimal points or not. 

 var aNumber=4.5;
 var anotherNumber=100;

 console. log (aNumber *anotherNumber);
 console.log (anotherNumber * 10);
 console.log(4 + 2);

 //Ints
 //Ints are integer values that have no decimal point. Numbers like 0, 1, 100, -5, etc

 //Floats are single precision decimal values.

 //Doubles
 //Doubles are double precision decimal values. They have twice as much precision as floats. Numbers in JavaScript are of this type.

 //BooLeans
 // BooLeans can have 1 of 2 values- true or false. We commonly use them to carry  out different code based on conditions. If the boolean is true do one thing, otherwise do another thing. 

 var needToGoToTheStore= true;
 var rainingToday= false;
 var needtogotothestore=true;
 var rainingtoday=false;
 


 //undefined/Null
// These mean basically nothing. We saw that  when we declared a variable without giving it a value, its value was logged as undefined.

//Strings are used to represent text. Strings are comprised of a collection of individual characters. For example the string "Hello" consists of the characters H, E, L, L, O. 

var schoolname= "Barren County High School";
var anotherString= "This is another string";

// We can also make strings that have nothing in them
var=emptyString="";
//Spaces also count as a character in a string.
var=spaceString="";
// We can also get the number of charcters in a string

console.log(schoolName.length);

//Make a variable containing your full name
var
